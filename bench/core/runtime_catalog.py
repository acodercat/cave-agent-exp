"""The registry of governed tables a case can expose to its runtime.

One entry per runtime table: the name the agent sees, the ``data_sources``
labels that expose it, the loader that materialises it, and the description
the runtime hands to the agent. Everything the evaluator needs to build either
an eager runtime (every declared table loaded up front as a DataFrame) or a
lazy one (a ``DataStore`` handle that loads on request) derives from this
tuple, so a new table is registered in exactly one place.

Labels are what case JSON declares. A label may expose several tables (a
source family such as ``sec_insider``), and a table may be reachable through
several labels (``companies_df`` accompanies every SEC label). Never make this
module import from ``cases/``.

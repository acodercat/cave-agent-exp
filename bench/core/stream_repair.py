"""Repair a model's code fences in the stream, before cave-agent parses them.

DeepSeek V4 answers an agent prompt with code written in its NATIVE tool
syntax some of the time — ``<｜DSML｜tool>`` … ``</｜DSML｜tool>``,
``<｜DSML｜python>`` … ``</｜DSML｜>``, or a markdown fence that it opens with
```` ```python ```` and then closes with a DSML tag instead of three backticks.
A serving stack that parses DSML strips the tags and leaves an unclosed
fence; one that does not parse it passes the tags straight through. Either
way cave-agent's parser, which knows only markdown fences, reaches the end of
the stream with a block it cannot call complete, and the agent — correctly,
for a stream that really was cut — refuses to execute an unfinished block.
The turn then ends with no code run and every variable unset.

Ported from a sibling benchmark, where it was
written and measured. There, turns that ended with no code run were 12 of 104
through one proxy and 8 of 104 on a local sglang mirror against 1 of 45 on the
hosted pro endpoint; with this module in place, 1 of 104 and 0 of 104. Counted
as failures they would have been the single largest category, and none of them
is a finding about the subject under test.

The FinBench measurement that motivated the port: of 953 stored turns across
``experiments/``, ten ended with ``stop_reason == "completed"`` and
``executed_code == False``, every one of them on ``deepseek-v4-pro-0813``
(2.6 per cent of that model's 389 turns). Nine carry an envelope this module
repairs -- five ``<pre><code class="language-python">``, three ``<invoke>``
envelopes with a ``<parameter name="code">`` body (twice naming
``execute_python`` and once ``exec_python``, which is why the scanner matches
the tag head and not the attribute), and one fence with a stray ``<`` in front
of it. The tenth is NOT in this family and
this module cannot help it: on `insider_option_exercise_intrinsic_capture` the
model emitted a fabricated ``<system-warning>`` describing a dtype problem, with
no code inside it at all. That is a hallucinated system message rather than a
mangled envelope, and it belongs in the failure taxonomy as its own category.

This module rewrites the content deltas as they stream:

- a DSML tag that names code (``python``, ``tool``, or a ``parameter`` called
  ``code``) opens a python fence if none is open;
- any DSML closing tag closes the fence if one is open;
- every other DSML tag is dropped — the bare ``<｜DSML｜>`` in particular is
  ambiguous (it precedes code, prose, and proper fences in the corpus) and
  opens nothing;
- when the provider ends the stream with ``finish_reason == "stop"`` and a
  fence is still open, the fence is closed. A ``length`` cut is left open:
  that block really is truncated, and cave-agent's refusal to run it stands.

The same model on the hosted pro endpoint leaks the envelope in ASCII
instead: ``<invoke name="exec">`` / ``<parameter name="code">`` … 
``</parameter>`` / ``</invoke>``, sometimes wrapped in ``<tool_calls>``,
``<system_calls>`` or ``<execution_tool>``, sometimes closed with a stray
``</execution_output>``, and once with a bare markdown fence INSIDE the code
parameter. Eight such responses were on disk by 2026-08-29, all pro, each
recorded as ``stop_reason: completed`` with ``errors: 0`` and no variable
set; on one case pro leaked on three attempts of five. Those ASCII tags are
handled by the same three rules — a bare fence line immediately after a
tag-opened fence is swallowed so it cannot close the block it was meant to
open — and every other ``<…>`` is passed through untouched. The HTML form,
``<pre><code class="language-python">`` … ``</code></pre>``, is in the same
family: the ``code`` tag opens when it names python, and ``</code>`` closes.
A CDATA section is handled too: ``<![CDATA[`` … ``]]>`` wraps real, runnable
code — the pro endpoint produced one on 2026-09-02 and another on 2026-09-03
(`beijing_exceedance_exposure_bias`), both times losing the turn — so it opens
a python fence and ``]]>`` closes it. It is the one envelope in this family
that is not an XML tag, so it is matched before the tag scanner runs.

So is the bare ``<python>`` … ``</python>`` the pro endpoint produced on
2026-09-02 (`hk_weather_variable_coverage`, Gate C of the split cases): the
DSML ``python`` tag with its marker stripped, handled by the same rule. The
same day's `hk_weekend_ozone_ox_conservation` turn opened with ``<```python``
— a proper fence with one stray ``<`` in front of it, which Markdown does not
read as a fence — so a ``<`` that stands at the head of a line immediately
before a fence is dropped. Nowhere else: a ``<`` mid-line is text.

What it does not do: guess that unfenced text after a bare tag is code. A
block the model never marked as code still does not run — that is today's
behaviour, and the residual is what a run reports as ``steps == 1`` with no
snippet. A ``<system_calls>`` holding prose and no code is that residual.

Every repair is logged at WARNING with the tag it acted on; counting those
lines in a run's output is how the figures above were measured.

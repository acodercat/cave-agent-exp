"""Principal-component key-rate hedge for a carried N-PORT bond fund.

A duration hedge that matches one number leaves a portfolio exposed to the shape of the
curve. Decomposing key-rate DV01s onto principal components separates the level, slope
and curvature moves that actually drive a bond fund's profit and loss, and a
three-instrument overlay can zero the first three of them exactly.

The solved overlay is 34,722.119 of one-year DV01, -300,321.124 of five-year and
-4,154,201.614 of thirty-year. The hedge-factor matrix has a 2-norm condition number of
3.8329, so the three-instrument system is well posted rather than nearly singular, and
the maximum absolute residual across the first three factor exposures is 0.0. Zeroing
three factors is not zeroing risk: the overlay leaves 4,884.877 of PC4 DV01 and
-668,238.560 of PC5, and it takes 4,489,244.857 of gross DV01 to put on.

The realized move over the following period was a twist rather than a level shift, with
the three-month yield down 65 basis points, the one-year down 55, the five-year down 23,
the ten-year down 5 and the thirty-year up 25. On that path the unhedged fund loses
94,307,323.86 dollars, 5.910295 percent of net assets, while the hedged fund gains
4,550,047.21, 0.285154 percent, a 98,857,371.07 dollar difference and a 95.1753 percent
reduction in absolute first-order profit and loss. A level-only duration hedge would not
merely have missed this move, it would have made things worse: offsetting the fund's
total DV01 at the ten-year point turns the loss into -116,337,028.23 dollars, because
the realized path fell hardest at the front end and rose at the long end. What the
three-factor overlay leaves behind is the unhedged fourth and fifth factors.

Every realized profit-and-loss figure is computed from the unrounded DV01s and overlay
notionals, not from the rounded figures reported for them, and the post-hedge residual is
pinned at 7 decimals so the shared rounding-boundary tolerance absorbs the noise any
convergent linear solve leaves behind.

The `nport_pca_hedge` convention sweep records sensitivity to the training-window start,
to decomposing the correlation rather than the covariance matrix, and to the choice of
hedge tenors. The query fixes all three, so these are robustness comparisons rather than
hidden answer paths.

Boundaries: this is a first-order DV01 approximation, so convexity and the actual
repricing of the underlying holdings are outside it, and the overlay is hypothetical with
no financing cost, bid-offer or margin. Principal components are estimated on this
training window and are not stable structural factors; a different window yields different
loadings, which is why the window is part of the question. The fund's key-rate DV01s are
derived from a period-end holdings snapshot and do not reflect intra-period trading.

"""Compare later bank outcomes by starting securities concentration.

The case forms a survivor panel at two year-end dates, records the coincident
ten-year par-yield move, and assigns equal-frequency fifths by each bank's
starting securities-to-assets share with certificate tie-breaking. Later turns
compare margin, deposit, book-equity and cumulative-income outcomes across those
fixed groups and within a large-bank subset.

The design is descriptive. Total securities do not identify accounting
classification, duration, purchase date or unrealized gains and losses. Book
equity changes combine earnings with distributions, capital actions, other
comprehensive income and other balance-sheet changes, none of which these fields
decompose. Positive cumulative earnings alongside lower ending equity establishes
only a negative net contribution from all non-earnings changes.

The survivor requirement omits banks that failed or merged, group comparisons do
not control for business model or other confounders, and a large-bank restriction
does not turn the result into a causal estimate. Correlations and tail-group
medians are different descriptive summaries and need not convey the same pattern.

This is a hard baseline case. Numeric validation uses the shared rounding
tolerance; counts match exactly.

The `bank_securities_channels` convention sweep records sensitivity to sorting on the
later date, to sorting on the securities amount rather than its share of assets, to
using group means rather than medians, to differencing the two group medians rather
than taking each bank's own change and then the median, to substituting domestic for
total deposits, and to dropping the asset floor. The aggregation order is the one worth
naming: the median is not linear, so the lowest group's margin change is 0.1901
percentage points as the median of per-bank changes and 0.134534 as the difference of
the two medians, and the highest group's is 0.0551 against 0.097894. Reporting both
group medians and then subtracting them is the natural reading of a loose phrasing, so
the query now states that the change is taken per bank first. Every one of these
choices is pinned by the query, making them robustness comparisons rather than hidden
answer paths.

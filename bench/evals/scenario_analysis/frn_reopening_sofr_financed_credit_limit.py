"""A financed Treasury floating-rate note, and the credit line it breaches.

A March 2025 reopening of the two-year floating-rate note is bought at auction
and funded entirely at realized SOFR. The note pays a quarterly coupon indexed to
the thirteen-week bill; the loan accrues daily. Each coupon is swept into
repayment on arrival, so the loan drifts with the difference between the two
rates rather than with either one, and the position needs no view on direction to
be worth measuring.

The identification is a data contract before it is a calculation. The auction
table does not carry a floating-rate security type: these notes are recorded as
Notes, and the `floating_rate` flag is what separates them. Exactly one such
auction settles in March 2025.

The coupon convention decides the answer. The index is the high discount rate of
the most recent thirteen-week bill auction, converted to an ACT/360 money-market
yield over that bill's own term, and it is frozen for the final two business days
before each payment date. Without the freeze the first coupon comes to 1.075643
per 100 rather than 1.075714, which is 0.71 dollars on a million of face and more
than ten times the tolerance this case scores at, so the query pins it.

Cash amounts are reported in USD thousands to five decimals rather than four.
A coupon settled to the cent is 10,757.14 dollars, which is 10.75714 thousand: a
four-decimal contract would leave 10.7571 and the incorrectly rounded 10.7572
both inside the shared tolerance, and a band wider than the value's own precision
is exactly what the validator contract forbids.

The financing leg pins its own conventions: a SOFR observation date defines a
business day, one simple factor covers each interval including the non-business
days inside it, and factors compound between intervals.

Rejected alternative conventions, each measured in the convention sweep:

- Freezing nothing before the payment date gives a first coupon of 10,756.43
  against 10,757.14, and a second post-payment loan balance of 999,756.51.
- Taking the index from the bill's issue date rather than its auction date, so a
  rate applies three days later than it does, gives a first coupon of 10,754.58.
- Converting the bill's discount rate over a fixed 91 days rather than its own
  term gives 10,757.04.
- Financing only the clean price and leaving the accrued interest unfunded starts
  the loan 6,770.46 lower and never reaches the credit limit at all, so the final
  turn reports no contribution.

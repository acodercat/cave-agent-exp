"""Constrained historical minimum-CVaR industry portfolio and OFR stress audit.

Minimizing conditional value at risk is a linear program in the Rockafellar-Uryasev
formulation, which is why practitioners reach for it instead of minimizing variance when
the loss distribution is asymmetric. The case builds that program on the five most
volatile Ken French industries, holds the weights fixed out of sample, and then asks
whether a stress index selects the days the portfolio actually lost money.

The 2018-2022 training window has 1258 days and the cohort is Durbl, Enrgy, HiTec, Other
and Manuf. The optimum is a corner solution, as constrained CVaR programs usually are:
HiTec sits exactly on the 0.35 cap, Other is held at 0.0, and the remaining weight is
split 8.9166, 22.4702 and 33.6132 percent. Training CVaR falls to 3.8715 percent
against 4.0099 for equal weights, and the linear program's maximum primal residual is
0.0.

Held out on 2023-2025, 751 days, the fixed weights compound to 80.4527 percent with
17.6290 percent annualized volatility and a 22.9520 percent maximum drawdown. Tail
performance survives the transfer: held-out CVaR is 2.4601 percent against 2.6277
for equal weights, an improvement of 0.1676 percentage points, slightly larger than
the 0.1385 the optimizer bought in sample. That ordering is a fact about this sample
and not a general property; an in-sample optimum is not owed out-of-sample
outperformance.

The stress audit is the negative result. On the ten highest-OFR test dates, mean index
2.0472, both portfolios gained rather than lost: mean realized loss is -0.7511
percent optimized and -0.6414 equal-weighted, so the optimized portfolio gained more
by 0.1097 percentage points. The optimized portfolio's own worst day, 2024-08-05 at
2.7065 percent, is not among the ten highest-stress dates at all. A market-wide stress
index and an equity portfolio's loss days are different events.

Every derived held-out figure is computed from the unrounded optimal weights, not from
the rounded percentages reported for them, so a model that carries its own full-precision
solution forward matches the pinned values.

The `industry_cvar_ofr` convention sweep records sensitivity to the tail probability, to
the per-industry weight cap, and to the mean floor. The query fixes all three, so these
are robustness comparisons rather than hidden answer paths.

The two panels are inner-joined on date, so a day enters only when both the industry
returns and the OFR FSI report it. Keeping every industry-return day instead reports 1259
training and 752 held-out days, because 2022-02-25 and 2024-02-14 trade without an OFR
observation; every downstream output reads ofr_fsi, so those days cannot carry the
stress audit.

Boundaries: this is a fixed-weight backtest with no rebalancing cost, turnover limit or
transaction friction, and the historical CVaR is an in-sample empirical quantile rather
than a distributional forecast. Ten stress dates are too few to characterize a tail, and
the OFR index is a market-wide construct that carries no information about which
industries were exposed.

"""Oil-conditioned Gaussian GARCH tail diagnostics for energy-industry returns.

Energy-industry excess returns are heteroskedastic and partly driven by oil, so a
constant-variance value-at-risk understates risk in turbulent months and overstates it
in calm ones. The case fits a GARCH(1,1) whose conditional mean carries the
contemporaneous WTI log return, then asks whether the resulting conditional tail
forecasts are calibrated out of sample.

The 2018-2022 fit gives an oil mean beta of 0.43729 and a variance recursion with
alpha 0.13192 and beta 0.85231, so persistence is 0.984227 and unconditional
volatility 2.033 percent per day. The training log likelihood is -2347.796258 and
the variance recursion reproduces itself exactly, with a maximum recursion residual of
0.0.

Over the 745 held-out days the one-percent conditional Gaussian bound is breached 7
times against 7.45 expected, a 0.939597 percent rate, and the Kupiec unconditional
coverage test cannot reject calibration with a likelihood ratio of 0.0280 and a
p-value of 0.8671. The interesting result is what happens inside the stress
subsample: on the ten highest-OFR-stress days conditional volatility nearly doubles to
2.1358 percent against 1.195352 on the other days, yet not one of those days breaches
the bound and the realized mean loss is -0.097 percent, a gain. Average expected
shortfall on those days is 5.8522 percent, so the model overshoots realized loss by
5.9492 percentage points. A model that passes an unconditional coverage test can still
be badly calibrated on the subsample a risk manager cares about.

The query fixes the estimator completely, including the two-start L-BFGS-B optimizer,
its relative objective tolerance and iteration cap, the parameterization and the
starting values, so the fitted parameters are determined by the question rather than by
the solver a model happens to reach for. The five parameters are pinned at 5 decimals
and every downstream quantity is computed from unrounded parameters.

Precision is set by what the optimizer reproduces, not by what the arithmetic could
print. Running this module on two machines that differ only in their BLAS moves the
fitted alpha in its sixth decimal, and the quantities derived from it move further:
persistence by 2e-8, implied unconditional volatility by 2e-6 and the stress-tail
Gaussian ES by 2e-6. Persistence, the perturbation loss, the conditional Gaussian VaR
and ES averages, and the three stress-tail volatility and ES figures are therefore
pinned at 4 to 6 decimals -- each with at least twenty-five times the observed
cross-machine spread in its tolerance -- so the shared rounding-boundary tolerance
absorbs solver dispersion between conforming implementations without admitting a second
estimator.

The `energy_garch_ofr_tail` convention sweep records sensitivity to using simple rather
than log WTI returns, to the tail probability, and to the number of stress days in the
subsample. The query fixes all three, so these are robustness comparisons rather than
hidden answer paths.

Boundaries: a Gaussian innovation is assumed rather than tested, so the tail forecasts
inherit that assumption and expected shortfall in particular is sensitive to it. The
conditional mean uses the contemporaneous oil return, which is a same-day conditioning
variable and not a forecast a risk manager would have had. The maximum stress day in the
sample, 2020-03-19 at an index of 10.266, sits inside the training window, so the
held-out stress days are milder, with a mean index of 2.0472.

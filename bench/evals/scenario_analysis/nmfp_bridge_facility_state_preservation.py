"""A money-fund liquidity vehicle, a Prime alternative, and a facility budgeted for the original.

A hypothetical USD10 million vehicle takes the balance-sheet mix of the three largest
Government money funds, with reported daily and weekly liquid assets released on a
stipulated ladder; withdrawals are met from that ladder and a bridge facility. A Prime
alternative is screened, funded and then constrained by a line sized to the Government
vehicle's peak draw, before the facility budget returns to the Government vehicle. The
Prime analysis must not overwrite the vehicle the budget is for.

Rejected alternative conventions, each measured in the convention sweep:

- Budgeting the facility on the Prime ledger instead of the Government vehicle's raises
  total financing cost from 7,860.1006 to 9,731.1157 USD and cuts the maximum
  commitment-fee rate from 238.3975 to 67.9312 basis points.
- Treating the whole weekly liquid-asset amount as available on day 1, instead of adding
  only its increment on day 5, lifts the day-1 fraction from 62.9738 to 78.3327 percent
  and lowers the Government peak draw from 2.7026 to 1.6667 million.
- Weighting the three selected series equally instead of by net assets changes 10 of the
  12 outputs, moving the blended maturity from 39.3691 to 39.6667 days.
- Accruing interest on Actual/365 instead of Actual/360 lowers Government interest from
  7,609.4065 to 7,505.1681 USD.

"""Estimate a rank-Gaussian common-stress direction across three BIS panels.

Three BIS stress features move together: a credit-to-GDP gap, a private-sector debt
service ratio and a real effective exchange-rate depreciation. Scoring an economy on
each one separately ignores that dependence. A Gaussian copula converts each feature to
a standard-normal score through its own empirical rank, then combines them under the
fitted correlation, so an economy that is moderately stressed on three correlated
measures is not counted three times.

The balanced pooled training panel holds 640 observations across 32 economies. The
Gaussian-copula correlations are -0.1161 between credit gap and DSR, 0.1682 between
gap and depreciation and 0.0828 between DSR and depreciation, with a correlation
condition number of 1.5605, so the combination is not read off a near-singular matrix.

Across the 32 scored economies the leader is JP, with a credit gap of 6.7837 percentage
points, a private DSR of 15.5 percent and real effective depreciation of 5.4420
percent. Its scores are 0.9906, 0.0490 and 1.1428, giving a common stress score of
1.130678 and an upper-tail probability of 0.12909537, ahead of the runner-up by 0.34715.
The three contributions, 0.590661, 0.030872 and 0.509145, reconcile to the score with a
residual of 0.0.

The conditional step is where the dependence would show, and here it barely moves.
Conditioning DSR on the other two features gives a mean of -0.0121 and a standard
deviation of 0.9878, so the leader's standardized residual is 0.061867 against an
unconditional score of 0.0490, and its conditional upper-tail probability is
0.4753. That is the arithmetic consequence of weak dependence: with pairwise
correlations of -0.1161, 0.1682 and 0.0828, knowing two features says almost
nothing about the third. The leader's debt service is unremarkable either way, and the
conditional machinery is what establishes that rather than assuming it.

The stated scenario raises the credit gap to 19.21154 percentage points, DSR to 30.11
percent and depreciation to 10.9049 percent. That lifts the common stress score to
2.750395 and cuts the tail probability to 0.00297618, a score increase of 1.619717 and a
probability ratio of 0.023054.

The case deliberately requires the solver to supply the Gaussian-copula and
conditional-normal formulas.  The query fixes rank, tie, clipping, covariance, and
quantile conventions without printing those formulas.

Boundaries: the Gaussian copula is assumed rather than tested, and it has no tail
dependence, so joint-tail probabilities are a property of that assumption rather than an
observed frequency. The tail probabilities are model quantities on 640 pooled
observations, not event rates. The scenario is a stated hypothetical, not a forecast or a
supervisory scenario, and the correlation matrix identifies no causal channel among the
three features.

The `bis_gaussian_copula` convention sweep records sensitivity to the training-window
start, to breaking rank ties by the minimum rather than the average, and to replacing
the fitted dependence with an identity correlation. The dependence choice is the one
worth naming: with an identity correlation the conditional step collapses, and the
leader's conditional DSR residual of 0.061867 could no longer distinguish a feature
that is unremarkable once the other two are known from one that is not. The query fixes
all three, so these are robustness comparisons rather than hidden answer paths.

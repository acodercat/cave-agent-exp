"""A forecast-sized WTI purchase program, a later proposal, and financing that stays with the original.

Monthly barrel quantities are fixed from the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook published on
2024-01-04 and hedged with the smallest common swap fraction that keeps every month under
a stressed cash ceiling. An independent proposal repeats the exercise on the 2024-04-04
forecast and is settled at observed prices; financing, warehousing and the terminal
borrowing base then return to the original program's committed quantities and swaps.

Rejected alternative conventions, each measured in the convention sweep:

- Financing the proposal's quantities instead of the original program's lowers terminal
  debt from 78.2589 to 70.5356 million.
- Keeping the original quantities but the proposal's hedge fraction gives terminal debt
  of 78.4180 million and a peak monthly outlay of 10.1476 instead of 10.0164 million.
- Dropping May from the purchase window cuts original inventory from 1,032.4283 to
  906.6422 thousand barrels.
- Reversing the swap direction, paying the spot average and receiving the fixed price,
  raises proposal gross swap payments from 0.6216 to 1.0489 million and terminal debt to
  79.5648 million.

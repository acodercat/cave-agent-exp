"""Read cross-border credit to emerging markets: what splits, and what cannot be compared.

The global liquidity indicators report credit to non-bank borrowers in emerging
economies in three currencies of denomination, each split into international
debt securities and bank loans. The split is exact: at 2025-Q4 dollar credit of
4,345,181.8 million comprises 2,433,764.1 of securities and 1,911,417.7 of
loans, and the same identity closes to zero for the euro and yen series.

The comparison the table invites is the one it cannot support. Each series is
denominated in its own currency, so the yen figure of 10,178,921.8 million is
millions of yen, not of dollars: dividing it by the dollar figure gives 2.3426,
a number with no economic content, and the table carries no exchange rate with
which to convert. Any statement that yen credit to these borrowers exceeds
dollar credit is a units error rather than a finding.

Within each currency the composition is comparable and it differs sharply.
Securities carry 56.0106 percent of dollar credit against 38.5757 percent of
euro credit and 28.5272 percent of yen credit, so the dollar series has the
highest securities share of the three. The dollar path shows
when: the securities share ran 32.2782 percent at 2010-Q4 and 34.2435 at
2015-Q4, then 48.9648 at 2020-Q4 and 56.0106 at 2025-Q4, while the stock of
dollar credit rose from 1,991,574.7 million to 4,345,181.8. Over the last of
those spans the dollar's broad nominal effective exchange rate rose from 94.9100
to 103.0400, 8.5660 percent. The case reports the index as separate currency
context and does not use two endpoint readings to explain the funding mix.

Regression probes measured in the `global_dollar_credit` sweep include ranking
unconverted published levels, using the wrong lender population, dividing by an
across-currency total, changing the requested periods, and substituting the real
effective exchange-rate series. The query pins each choice, so these are baseline
instruction-following probes rather than a live hidden-method trap. This is a hard
baseline case.

Knowledge used by the case: a currency of denomination is also the measurement
unit of the published level, while a within-currency component share is invariant
to that unit. The source identifies the instrument mix but not the ultimate holder
of each debt security, its tradability, or the cause of a change in composition.

Boundaries: the loan series is reported by banks while the securities series is
reported for all lending sectors, so the two components come from different
reporting populations even though they add to the published total. The effective
exchange rate index begins in 2019 in this artifact, which is why the exchange
rate context covers only the most recent span.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; period labels match exactly.

"""Separate the Form 13F cover-page scale change from the filer-level holding unit.

Two unit conventions sit in the same 13F data and are routinely conflated. The
cover-page value total moved to whole dollars for filings made from 2023-01-03:
across 13F-HR filings the median raw cover total per holding row rises from 4,045.1073 at
2022-09-30 to 2,566,817.2733 at 2022-12-31, a factor of 634.5486, so summing the
field across that boundary produces a 155.5333-fold step that is a units
artifact. The holding rows carry a separate, per-filer unit that the governed
tables infer: at 2022-12-31, 5,758 filings report holdings in dollars and 1,309
in thousands, while the cover page reads as dollar scale for 5,799 and thousands
scale for 1,268. The two classifications agree on 96.5615 percent of filings but
disagree on 243, so one cannot be used as per-filing metadata for the other.

Reading the already-normalized holdings aggregation instead gives 75.484185
trillion USD over 36,120 issuer rows at 2022-12-31, led by Apple Inc. at
1.464846 trillion USD across 4,569 filing accessions. Dividing that USD total by
the raw, mixed-scale cover-page sum produces the number 2.1700, but not a
unit-consistent ratio. Carrying that issuer into the
registrant universe, its 10,535,889,677 reported shares stand against
15,821,946,000 shares outstanding as of 2023-01-20 from the latest count filed on
or before 2023-02-15, a 66.5904 percent reported-shares quotient. It is not total
institutional or beneficial ownership: the reporting population, security scope,
measurement dates, and shared-discretion reporting all differ. 975 of the 7,067
filings include other managers' holdings, but that count does not quantify duplicate
shares.

The `thirteen_f_unit_break` convention sweep records sensitivity to including
amendments, rescaling the cover page with the holding-row convention, changing the
cover heuristic, ranking by shares, and selecting a different outstanding-share
fact. The query fixes the reported convention, so these are robustness comparisons
rather than hidden answer paths.

The counts are of filings, not of filers. Three managers submit a duplicate qualifying
13F-HR with identical totals -- CIK 1767435 at 2022-09-30, CIK 93751 and CIK 1016021 at
2022-12-31 -- so collapsing to distinct filers reports 6,745 and 7,065 instead of 6,746
and 7,067. The medians and sums are taken over the same per-filing population.

Two boundaries are load bearing. The cover-page scale is a per-filing property,
not a rule that holds without exception: 8.55 percent of filings for periods
from 2022Q4 still read as thousands scale and 9.29 percent of earlier filings
read as dollar scale, so the query classifies each filing rather than assuming
the period. The 100,000 reported-units-per-row cut is stated in the query because
nothing in the data labels each cover-page value's scale. It is an analytic
heuristic, not a consequence of the statutory $100 million manager threshold.
Sweeping it from 20,000 to 500,000 puts the disagreement count at
374, 263, 243, 250 and 416, so 100,000 sits at the minimum, the point where the
cover-page reading agrees most closely with the independently inferred
holding-row unit. The answer is fixed by the query either way.

Fragility: the leading issuer is 2.4829 percent ahead of the runner-up in
reported value, 1.464846 against 1.428476 trillion USD, so the top of the
ranking is a two-name race rather than a wide margin; the frozen artifact fixes
it.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts, identifiers and names match exactly.

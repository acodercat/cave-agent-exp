"""Compare SBA 504 financing weights with state establishment-normalized activity.

The frozen privacy-reduced SBA extract has no guaranteed unique loan identifier,
so the population is explicitly reported source rows rather than deduplicated
borrowers or loans. Across the 50 states and District of Columbia, 2,135 rows
meet the calendar-2025 approval, disbursement and positive-financing rules. Their
2.013060 billion USD of SBA gross approvals and 2.657696711 billion USD of
third-party financing produce a 43.0992% ratio of sums, versus a 44.4259%
unweighted mean row share and a -1.3267-point gap.

South Dakota has 30 eligible rows and 38,496 preliminary 2025 private annual-
average establishments, or 7.7930 rows per 10,000 establishments. Its 47.484228
million USD combined financing has a 43.5008% aggregate SBA share versus a
43.3444% mean row share, a +0.1563-point gap.

Fiscal-year rather than calendar-year approval, approval-only rather than
disbursed rows, total-covered rather than private establishments, and including
Puerto Rico are measured regression alternatives. The query pins all four, so
this is a hard baseline. Numeric validation uses 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary
tolerance for N requested decimals; counts are exact and USPS labels normalize
casing and repeated whitespace.

Fragility: the leading state (SD, 30 loan rows) is 0.36 loans per 10,000
establishments ahead of UT, so a handful of reclassified rows would flip the
leader, and the 2025 QCEW establishment counts are a preliminary vintage.

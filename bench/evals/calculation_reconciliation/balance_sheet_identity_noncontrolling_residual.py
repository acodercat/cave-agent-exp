"""Test two balance-sheet identities, one that holds and one that cannot.

A balance sheet foots: assets equal the total of liabilities and equity. Across
the 4,274 annual statement observations with a 2024-12-31 balance-sheet date, 4,165 of the
4,168 that report both sides agree to the dollar and the largest disagreement
anywhere is 4,000 USD. The identity that looks like the same statement does not
hold: subtracting liabilities and stockholders' equity from assets leaves a
non-zero remainder on 1,145 of 3,516 observations, with a median of 26.1 million USD
and a maximum of 38,333,124,000 USD at KKR. The reason is a reporting
convention, not an error -- the equity line is the parent's share -- and the
remainder can be closed exactly: KKR reports 36,747,947,000 USD of
noncontrolling interests and 1,585,177,000 USD of redeemable noncontrolling
interests carried outside permanent equity, and those two sum to the remainder
with nothing left over.

The last turn measures a selection effect that any ratio screen on this table
inherits. Of the 4,274 observations, 3,096, or 72.4380 percent, present both
current subtotals; 3,095 of those also have positive current liabilities. The 1,178 that do not present both are led
by real estate investment trusts and commercial banks, whose balance sheets are
ordered by liquidity rather than split into current and non-current. A current
ratio computed on the positive-denominator observations is therefore a statistic about
non-financial issuers, and its median of 1.6604 should not be quoted as a
market-wide figure.

Rejected alternatives (each measured in the `balance_sheet_identity` sweep
registration): including quarterly reports and amendments in the annual
population; counting a remainder as zero when it is merely small rather than
exactly zero; closing the remainder with noncontrolling interests alone and
omitting the redeemable portion; and computing the current ratio over all
observations by treating an absent subtotal as zero. The query pins all five, so this
is a hard baseline.

Ranking the remainders by absolute size rather than by signed size reproduces
the same leader and is registered as an equivalent: the largest positive
remainder is 38,333,124,000 USD while the most negative is -744,442,000, so no
negative case comes close.

The population carries one repeated issuer: 4,274 statement observations map to
4,273 central index keys, so an observation count and an issuer count are not
interchangeable here.
Ratio screens are also scale-sensitive, which is why the ratio leader is drawn
from observations with at least one billion USD of current assets; without that
floor the ranking is dominated by shell and pre-revenue registrants.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts, identifiers and names match exactly.

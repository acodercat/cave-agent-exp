"""Compare minimum- and ending-ratio measures of the stress capital decline.

Under 12 CFR 225.8(f)(2), one input to a firm's stress capital buffer is the fall
in its common equity tier 1 ratio from the starting ratio to the lowest projected
ratio in the planning horizon. Planned common dividends are added to that decline,
and the resulting calculation is compared with a 2.5 percent floor. This case
isolates only the decline component; it does not reconstruct an assigned buffer.

The 2025 exercise publishes 23 rows for the severely adverse scenario, but one of
them is an aggregate labelled for the participating banks and carries no identifier,
leaving 22 firms. Their median starting ratio is 12.9500 percent, their median
trough 11.1000 and their median ending ratio 12.8000, so the level a firm finishes
with sits far closer to where it began than its projected minimum. On
17 of the 22 the trough and the ending ratio differ at all.

Measured to the trough the median decline is 1.9500 points; measured to the ending
ratio it is 1.1000, a median gap of 0.4000. Taken to the trough, 12 of the
22 have a decline at or below the 2.5-point benchmark; taken to the ending ratio,
16 do. The ending reference adds 4 firms to that descriptive group. These counts
do not identify which assigned buffers equal the floor because the planned-dividend
add-on is absent. Four firms show a minimum ratio above their own starting ratio,
and the largest decline is 11.0000 points; the ratios alone do not separate
numerator-capital from denominator-RWA effects.

The pattern holds across the four exercises run under this framework. They cover 109
firm-scenario results, of which 55 have a minimum-based decline at or below the
benchmark and 70 have an ending-based decline at or below it; the 2022 exercise
diverges most, by 6 firms.

None of these firms can be looked up in the Call Report capital file, and the reason
is structural rather than a matching failure: 0 of the 22 appear there, because the
identifiers name holding companies, 15 of them financial holding companies, 6
intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations and 1 a savings and
loan holding company. A Call Report is filed by an insured depository, which is a
subsidiary of these firms and not the entity the test covers.

The `stress_capital_buffer` convention sweep records sensitivity to using the
ending ratio, retaining aggregate rows, widening the exercise set, changing the
2.5-point boundary, and using means. The query fixes the reported convention, so
these are robustness comparisons rather than hidden answer paths.

Entity boundary: the stress-test identifiers in the focus population are holding
companies, while Call Report filer identifiers represent insured depository
institutions. A direct identifier match therefore does not bridge parent and
subsidiary entities.

Boundaries: the files do not carry the planned-dividend add-on or enough information
to apply any exercise-specific averaging or subsequent adjustment, so the computed
quantity is the stress capital decline component and not the buffer a firm is
assigned. The ratios are published to one decimal, so declines are differences of
rounded figures. The four exercises cover overlapping but non-identical panels.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts and exercise names match exactly.

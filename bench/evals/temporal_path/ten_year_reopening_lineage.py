"""Hard cross-source baseline joining an auction lineage to its MSPD representation.

CUSIP 91282CMM0 has an original 10-year auction and two reopenings whose shorter
remaining-term labels must not split the lineage.  A literal 10-Year filter keeps
one auction, 42.0 billion USD offered and 53.5379607 billion accepted instead of
three auctions, 120.0 billion offered and 138.7086321 billion accepted.

At 2025-04-30 MSPD represents the same CUSIP with three issue-date rows.  Keeping
only the original-issue row gives 53.5386697 billion USD issued instead of the
138.7042713 billion cumulative issued amount.  CUSIP-level outstanding is reported
once, not once per issue row, and is also 138.7042713 billion.  Auction accepted
minus MSPD issued is +0.0043608 billion, so forcing a zero cross-source residual is
not valid.  Numeric validation uses 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance; dates,
lists, counts and the CUSIP are exact.  Because the query explicitly requests the
CUSIP lineage, reopenings, cumulative issue rows and stock-versus-flow explanation,
the literal-term and original-row alternatives are regression probes rather than
unprompted diagnostic traps.

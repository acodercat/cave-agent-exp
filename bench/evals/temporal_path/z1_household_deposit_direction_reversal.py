"""A quarter whose published direction reversed, and the regulatory reading beside it.

The Financial Accounts are republished as complete vintages, so the same quarter
carries a different value in every release that covers it. Households' checkable
deposits and currency for 2024-Q3 were first published on 2024-12-12 as a rise of
114,760 million over 2024-Q2; the 2025-09-11 vintage reports the same quarter as
a fall of 68,796 million. Both readings are internally consistent, and neither is
an error: the level for 2024-Q3 was revised down by 241,573 million while the
level for 2024-Q2 was revised down by only 58,017 million, and a quarter that
loses more than the quarter before it changes sign.

FDIC BankFind sits beside this as a reading that is not revised into vintages:
total deposits at insured institutions rose 262,470.957 million over the same two
quarter-ends. It agrees in direction with the first Z.1 release and disagrees
with the current one, which is a scope result rather than an arbitration. Z.1
measures what one holder sector owns; BankFind measures what every depositor has
placed at insured institutions, so business, government, foreign and trust
balances sit inside the second number and outside the first.

Rejected alternative conventions, each measured in the convention sweep:

- Differencing across vintages -- taking 2024-Q3 from the 2024-12-12 release that
  introduced it against 2024-Q2 from the 2024-09-12 release that introduced that,
  which is what a reader of successive press releases accumulates -- gives
  +134,577. It is not the first-release reading (+114,760) and not the current
  reading (-68,796); a quarterly change is defined inside one vintage, and this
  is the wrong path the convention sweep measures.
- Reading the series from a single statement table rather than deduplicating it
  across the four that carry it changes no value, because the four agree, but a
  naive row count then reports 819 rows where 273 distinct observations exist.
- Taking BankFind domestic deposits (DEPDOM) instead of total deposits (DEP)
  gives a smaller change of 198,363.293 million; the direction survives but the
  level does not, and the query pins the total.

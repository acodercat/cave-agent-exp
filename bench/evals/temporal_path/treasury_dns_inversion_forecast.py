"""Dynamic Nelson--Siegel forecast at the deepest SOFR-era inversion.

The case selects the common Treasury/SOFR date with the most negative 10-year
minus 2-year CMT spread, bootstraps every trailing curve into continuously
compounded zero yields, and estimates one shared Diebold--Li decay parameter by
panel least squares.  The parameter is identified by the global minimum on the
declared compact interval; date-specific level, slope and curvature factors are
linear conditional on that decay.

The terminal comparison estimates a full VAR(1) for the carried factor history
and forecasts the next Treasury curve date.  It compares the resulting curve
forecast with a factor random walk.  This is a retrospective analytical
benchmark, not a no-arbitrage production curve or evidence that inversion alone
predicts returns.  Repricing, conditional OLS orthogonality and VAR stability are
the numerical invariants.  Intermediate calculations retain full precision.

The `treasury_dns_forecast` convention sweep records sensitivity to treating reported
par yields as zero yields instead of bootstrapping them, to a 250-curve rather than
252-curve training window, and to estimating separate AR(1) factor dynamics rather than
a full VAR(1). The curve basis is the one worth naming: reading par as spot
skips the bootstrap entirely, so it changes every zero yield the factors are fitted to
rather than only the forecast. The query fixes all three, so these are
robustness comparisons rather than hidden answer paths.

Boundaries: the shared decay is identified by a global minimum on a declared compact
interval, so it is a panel fit rather than a market-implied parameter. The VAR(1)
spectral radius of 0.9848 sits close to the unit circle on 252 observations, so its
stability is a diagnostic rather than an established property, and one next-date
comparison cannot establish forecast skill.

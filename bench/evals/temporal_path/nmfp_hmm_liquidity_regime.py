"""Two-state Gaussian HMM for aggregate money-fund flow/liquidity regimes.

Money market fund flows and portfolio liquidity are usually described in regime language:
funds are said to be in a calm state or a stressed one. A hidden Markov model makes that
language testable, because it produces both a fitted state sequence and a predictive
density that can be scored against a single-Gaussian alternative.

The aligned panel runs 372 days from 2024-06-03 to 2025-11-28 across 330 matched filings.
The heaviest single-day net outflow, 2024-11-14 at -0.8741 percent of assets, occurs
while weekly liquid assets stand at 81.3107 percent and SOFR at 4.58 percent, so the
worst flow day of the sample is not a day of impaired liquidity.

Expectation-maximization converges in 12 iterations over 300 training days to a log
likelihood of -653.606581, and both states are persistent: the calm-to-stress transition
probability is 0.01931034 and stress-to-calm 0.01419855, implying mean durations of tens
of days rather than day-to-day switching. What separates the states is liquidity rather
than direction of flow. The stress state carries mean weekly liquid assets of 80.4091
percent against 82.5289 in the calm state, while mean net flow is positive in both,
0.0460 against 0.0836 percent. Posterior mass and scaled forward likelihood residuals
are both 0.0.

The out-of-sample result is negative and is the point of the case. Over the 72 test days
the two-state model beats the single Gaussian on average predictive log score,
-1.62295459 against -2.24292589, an improvement of 0.6199713, and the filtered stress
probability reaches 0.9994187 on 2025-09-24. Yet the classification carries no next-day
flow information: the 54 stress-classified days are followed by mean net flow of 0.0827
percent and the calm-classified days by 0.0734, so stress-classified days are followed
by slightly stronger inflows, a difference of 0.0094 percentage points in the wrong
direction for a stress signal. A model that fits the density better is not thereby a
usable early warning.

The `nmfp_hmm_liquidity_regime` convention sweep records sensitivity to the flow scaling,
to the posterior cutoff used to classify a day, and to which fitted state is labelled the
stress state. The query fixes all three, so these are robustness comparisons rather than
hidden answer paths.

Boundaries: two states are imposed, not selected by an information criterion, and the
Gaussian emission is assumed rather than tested. The state labels are a modelling
convention attached to fitted moments and carry no regulatory or supervisory meaning.
Aggregate flows conceal offsetting movements between individual funds, and 72 test days
with 54 classified one way cannot establish predictive value in either direction.

"""Securities that failed to deliver every day of a quarter, and what short volume shows.

A fail to deliver is a settlement outcome, and the reflex reading is that a
security failing day after day is being shorted hard. The 2025-Q1 record does not
support that reading. Forty-four symbols failed on every one of the 61 settlement
dates in the quarter. Of those, only sixteen appear in the FINRA daily
short-volume file at all, and their median short share of reported volume is
54.7488 per cent against a market-wide median of 46.4495 -- above it, but by
eight points rather than by the margin the reflex predicts. Their median reported
volume is 23,297,682.5 shares against 2,862,359.5 for the file as a whole, so the
persistent failures sit in liquid names, not obscure ones.

The twenty-eight unmatched members carry the case's second point. The largest
peak among them, CYDY at 6,783,255 shares, has no short-volume record at all: the
FINRA file reports what its member firms print on their own tapes, so a security
can fail every day of a quarter and leave no trace in it. An analyst who screens
for shorting pressure by joining these two files sees neither the whole
population nor a position: short volume is executed daily flow flagged short,
which is not short interest, and a fail is a settlement failure, which is not a
position either.

Rejected alternative conventions, each measured in the convention sweep:

- Keying the fail population by CUSIP rather than by trading symbol also returns
  44 persistent securities here, so the two agree on the count; the symbol is
  pinned because it is the key the short-volume file uses.
- Requiring a fail on at least half the settlement dates rather than on all of
  them returns 3,883 securities, of which 3,372 are reported, and a cohort median
  short share of 51.0812 per cent, which moves the comparison most of the way
  back to the market median.
- Taking the mean rather than the median gives 57.3545 per cent for the cohort
  against 46.5410 for the file, preserving the direction while changing both
  levels.
- Ranking the cohort by fails summed across dates instead of by the largest
  single-date level selects CYDY, whose 198,947,427 summed shares lead the
  cohort, rather than PACB. That is the wrong path this case measures: a summed
  level double counts a fail that stays open across settlement dates, and CYDY is
  precisely the security the short-volume file does not report.

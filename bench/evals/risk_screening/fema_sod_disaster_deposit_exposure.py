"""Measure large-bank branch-deposit exposure to declared disaster counties.

Nineteen FEMA major-disaster declarations beginning and declared in the first
half of 2025 cover 359 distinct valid county FIPS.  Among the 50 banks with the
largest 2025-06-30 SOD branch-deposit totals, Bank of America has the largest
exposed dollar amount ($124.117307B, 6.2843%), while City National Bank has the
largest exposed share ($50.241248B of $77.761501B, or 64.6094%).  City National's
46.9697% exposed branch-row share demonstrates that branch counts and deposits
weight geography differently.

Joining FEMA declaration-area rows without first forming the county set,
including emergency declarations, allowing later declaration dates, changing
the incident-year rule, using a top-20 cohort or weighting by branch counts
changes at least one requested result.  The query pins these conventions, so
they are regression probes for a hard baseline rather than live traps.  Numeric
validation uses 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance; counts and identifiers
are exact, and bank-name casing and repeated whitespace are normalized.

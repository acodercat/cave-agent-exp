"""Compare a net-redemption proxy with gross money-fund flow activity.

The 2023 amendments to the money market fund rules require an institutional prime
or institutional tax exempt fund to impose a liquidity fee on a day when net
redemptions exceed 5 percent of net assets, unless the liquidity costs the fund
incurs are de minimis. The threshold is written on net flow, which is the
difference between what came in and what went out. Gross subscriptions plus
redemptions instead measure two-way transaction activity; they are not the
liquidity a portfolio had to raise.

The daily flow file reports 247,400 rows at the share class level across 1,053
classes, while net assets are reported once per series filing. A series files once
per period, and an amendment supersedes the filing it corrects, so the population
keeps the latest filing for each series period before the classes are summed:
2,419 series-days are covered by both an original N-MFP3 and its N-MFP3/A, and 226
of those pairs report different flows, so retaining both would enter the same day
twice with two different answers. Summing the classes of the retained filing on
each day gives 71,931 series-day observations over 316 series, a median of 2
classes each.

Dividing a daily flow by net assets needs care, because the asset figure is dated
the series report date at the end of the period while the flow is dated within it.
A fund that shrank sharply is measured against what was left. 492 series-days
report net assets below one million dollars, and 17 observations put a single day's
net flow beyond 100 percent of the fund's assets. Requiring at least a million
dollars leaves 71,439 observations, and even there the largest single-day net
redemption reaches -176.9093 percent of the reported base, so the ratio remains an
approximation rather than a measurement.

On that screened population the median absolute net balance is 0.3033 percent of
assets and median gross activity is 1.1841 percent. Their ratio has a median of
3.2406, computed on the 66,246 observations where net flow is not zero: 5,193 days,
7.2691 percent, show none, and 5,168 of those show no flow at all. Government funds
show a median 1.5743 percent gross-activity day against 0.8551 for prime.

Counted against 5 percent of the same period-end denominator, the two proxies do not
describe the same construct. Net redemptions exceed 5 percent on 1,788 series-days;
gross activity exceeds 5 percent on 15,783, a factor of 8.8272. Government funds
cross the gross line on 26.1362 percent of their days while prime funds cross the
net line on 0.8527 percent of theirs. Prime and the two tax-exempt categories,
which can contain covered funds, hold 18,895 of the screened days and 182 of the
1,788 proxy net crossings, 10.1790 percent. The file does not identify which series
are institutional.

The `money_fund_flow_trigger` convention sweep records sensitivity to retaining
share-class grain, dropping the analytic asset screen, using redemptions rather than
net flow, changing the percentage threshold, narrowing the category screen, and
retaining superseded filings instead of the latest one per series period. The query
fixes the reported convention, so these are robustness comparisons rather than
hidden answer paths.

Measurement boundary: flows are reported per share class while assets are reported
per series, and the available asset figure is a period-end snapshot rather than the
daily net asset base used by the rule.

Boundaries: the file carries no institutional or retail designation, so the
category screen is not a count or proven upper bound of funds subject to the rule,
and the fee is owed only when the estimated fee is not de minimis, which nothing
here observes. The threshold in the rule is evaluated by the fund on its own daily
asset base, which this file does not carry, so the ratios here are built on a period
end figure instead. The mandatory-fee compliance date was 2024-10-02 while the flow
file opens on 2024-06-03; the 1,136 series-days that precede it are 1.5902 percent
of the screened population and carry 3 of the 1,788 net crossings and none of the
182 in the fee-eligible categories, so the overlap does not move any figure
reported here.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts and fund names match exactly.

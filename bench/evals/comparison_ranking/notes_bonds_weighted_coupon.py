"""Compare Treasury coupon stock with 2025 nominal auction-yield flow.

At 2025-12-31, conventional notes have 15,636.8393201 billion USD outstanding
at a 3.08855463% outstanding-weighted stated coupon; bonds have 5,248.9742071
billion at 3.30224808%, a 0.21369344-point bond-minus-note gap. Calendar-2025
nominal fixed-rate issuance contains 60 note auctions, including 9 reopenings,
with 3,372 billion USD offered at a 3.94448606% offering-weighted high yield;
24 bond auctions, including 16 reopenings, offer 444 billion at 4.78658108%.
The respective auction-yield-minus-stock-coupon gaps are 0.85593143 and
1.48433300 percentage points.

Equal-weighting security rows or auctions, excluding reopenings, and admitting
TIPS are all measured alternatives. The query pins outstanding principal for
the stock, offering amount for the flow, and nominal fixed-rate original plus
reopening auctions, so this is a hard baseline. Numeric validation uses
0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for N requested decimals; counts are
exact.

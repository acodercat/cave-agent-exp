"""Scale supervisory stress projections by same-date Y-9C total equity.

Twenty-two holding companies appear in both the 2025 supervisory severely
adverse results and the same-date Y-9C balance sheet.  Their $471.900 billion of
projected total loan losses is 25.4407% of their $1,854.898991 billion of
combined total equity, while the simple mean of the twenty-two entity ratios is
26.3632% -- a -0.9224 point difference, because the ratio of sums weights each
firm by its own equity.  Capital One leads loss-to-equity at 88.3465% (RSSD
2277860, $60.7834 billion of equity against $53.700 billion of losses) and
American Express leads provision-to-equity at 89.8758% (RSSD 1275216).  A stress
projection is a supervisory scenario output, not a forecast, and equity absorbing
a projected loss on paper is not a statement about either firm's solvency.

The convention sweep measures the Y-9C period, the equity denominator, cohort
aggregation, the loss measure and the CET1 endpoint.  Taking the latest available
Y-9C instead of the stress exercise's own as-of date raises combined equity to
$1,969.255617 billion and flips the aggregation difference to +0.3462 points;
using consolidated assets as the denominator reports 2.3476% rather than
25.4407%; aggregating as a simple mean of the entity ratios reports the cohort
ratio as 26.3632% and the difference as zero by construction; ranking the second
leader on projected loan losses instead of projected provisions moves it from
American Express to Capital One; and reading the stress end-of-horizon CET1
instead of the projected minimum gives 9.3% and 12.7% rather than 9.2% and 9.4%.
The query pins all five, so these are regression probes for a hard baseline
rather than live traps.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for N
requested decimals; the entity count, names and RSSD identifiers match exactly.

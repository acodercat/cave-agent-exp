"""Compare capital measures across CBLR electors and non-electors.

The case links the 2025-09-30 Call Report capital schedule to BankFind through
the current NIC RSSD-to-certificate bridge, then applies a BankFind total-asset
band. NIC's primary federal regulator supplies independent institution context
for the lowest-leverage elector and prevents the identifier table from serving
as a replaceable bridge only.

CBLR electors and non-electors both report the tier-1 leverage ratio, while the
selected electors do not report standardized risk-weighted assets or CET1 ratios.
An elector below 9 percent is not, from this snapshot alone, proof of a violation:
the framework includes grace-period mechanics above its lower boundary, and
eligibility history is not present in the declared tables.

The final turn contrasts BankFind book equity over ending total assets with tier-1
capital over the regulatory leverage denominator. A divergence can reflect
regulatory capital adjustments, measurement scope and different denominators;
these sources do not isolate AOCI treatment or any other cause for a bank's gap.

The convention sweep measures central tendency, the CET1 population, the
threshold rule and the leverage measure. Taking means instead of medians reports
12.5139% and 11.2255% rather than 11.3685% and 10.1835%, and widens the gap to
1.2884 points. Substituting BankFind book equity over ending assets for the
regulatory tier-1 leverage ratio reports 11.0315% and 10.0264%, a 1.0050-point
gap, and raises the count below the threshold from 1 to 21 -- the two measures
are not interchangeable even though both are leverage ratios. Widening the CET1
population to the whole asset band and reading the threshold inclusively are both
numerically equivalent on this frozen snapshot, because no elector sits exactly
on the boundary and the non-electors are the only band members reporting CET1.
The query pins all four choices.

This is a medium baseline case. Numeric validation uses the shared rounding
tolerance; counts and labels match exactly.

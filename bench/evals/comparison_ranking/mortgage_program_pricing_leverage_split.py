"""Compare reported HMDA pricing and leverage by loan-type code.

The 1.5-percentage-point spread screen is an analyst-defined common cutoff for
this first-lien population, not a legal HPML classification.  Regulation Z uses
1.5 points for non-jumbo first liens and 2.5 points for jumbo first liens, while
subordinate liens use 3.5 points.  The runtime lacks rate-lock dates and the
applicable conforming-limit test needed to apply those legal thresholds row by
row.

Loan type 1 is conventional, 2 FHA-insured, 3 VA-guaranteed, and 4 RHS- or
FSA-guaranteed.  Cross-sectional differences in reported APR-minus-APOR spread
and loan-to-value are descriptive.  They do not isolate the effect of insurance
or a guarantee, establish borrower quality, or prove a program eligibility or
down-payment rule.  LTV medians use nonmissing reported LTV and are accompanied
by their valid-row counts because missingness differs materially by type.

The rate-spread screen separately reports missing and outside-band rows.  A
first lien is selected for priority comparability; a junior lien has a different
claim priority, not different physical collateral by definition.

The FHFA traditional purchase-only HPI is a weighted repeat-sales index based on
Enterprise mortgage data.  It estimates same-property price change and is not a
median of HMDA loan amounts.  The source populations, financing coverage and
measures differ, so state HPI growth cannot be interpreted as growth in the
typical originated loan.

The convention sweep measures the lien scope, the spread band, the higher-priced
threshold, the index series and the index window.  Admitting subordinate liens
raises the origination count from 4,766,398 to 6,191,825; keeping any reported
spread instead of the plausibility band moves the banded count from 4,140,735 to
4,146,528; applying the 3.5-point subordinate threshold to this first-lien
population drops the conventional above-cutoff share from 7.2303% to 1.7744% and
the FHA share from 6.4608% to 0.0189%, which is why the legal thresholds are not
interchangeable across lien positions; reading the seasonally adjusted HPI reports
2.3888% growth rather than 2.4265%; and measuring within the activity year instead
of fourth quarter over fourth quarter reports 1.0810%.  The query pins all five
choices.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts and state codes match exactly.

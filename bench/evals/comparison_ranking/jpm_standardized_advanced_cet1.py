"""Separate a bank CET1 denominator comparison from its parent's stress path.

The retained 2025-Q3 Call Report identifies JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. by RSSD
852218.  The current NIC snapshot observed 2026-08-13 maps that bank to immediate
parent JPMorgan Chase & Co., RSSD 1039502 and entity type FHD, on a relationship-
level-1 row.  That parent, not the bank, is the legal entity in the 2025
supervisory severely adverse stress results.  Joining the bank RSSD directly to
the stress table returns zero rows.  Omitting the relationship-level filter gives
the same parent in this frozen snapshot because the bank has only one current
controlled/regulatory relationship; that numerical equivalence does not make the
unfiltered rule a general definition of immediate parent.

At the bank, $291.288 billion of CET1 divided by $1,856.46605 billion of
standardized RWA and $1,737.022 billion of advanced-approaches RWA gives
15.6904566% and 16.7693904%, a 1.0789338 percentage-point gap.  At the parent,
the stress disclosure reports 15.7% actual CET1 as of 2024-12-31 and a 14.2%
projected minimum, a -1.5 percentage-point change.  Substituting the nearby Tier
1 and supplementary leverage ratios gives 7.8478% and 6.4731%, while selecting
the stress end ratio instead of the projected minimum gives 15.8%; these are
measured regression probes, not designated traps because the query pins the
requested measures.

Numeric validation uses 0.6 × 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for N requested
decimals: three for USD billions, four for bank ratios and their gap, and one for
stress ratios and their change. Identifiers, the entity-type code and the date
match exactly; parent-name capitalization and repeated whitespace are normalized.

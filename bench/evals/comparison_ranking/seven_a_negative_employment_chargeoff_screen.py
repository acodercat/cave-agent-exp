"""Screen equal-horizon SBA charge-offs with a later state labor measure.

Across the 50 states and DC, 24 states have at least 500 reported FY2022 7(a)
loan rows after the disbursement and cutoff rules.  New York has the highest
36-month charge-off incidence overall at 3.4247%, but Maryland leads the six
states with negative 2024-to-2025 private annual-average employment growth at
2.9008%.  Maryland's charge-off amount is 0.4545% of cohort gross approvals.

Dropping exact-looking public rows changes New York's count and incidence; using
a 250-row floor instead of 500 selects Louisiana overall; using total-covered
rather than private employment, the source's rounded change field rather than
the two employment levels, or the later snapshot status rather than dated
36-month events changes the population or outputs.  The query pins these
conventions, so the alternatives are regression probes for a hard baseline.
Numeric validation uses 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance; counts and state
labels are exact.

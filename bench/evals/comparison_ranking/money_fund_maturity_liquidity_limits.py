"""Read a money market fund against the rule that governs it.

Rule 2a-7 caps two different maturity measures. Weighted average maturity may not
exceed 60 days and weighted average life may not exceed 120, and the two differ
because only the first may be computed to a floating security's next interest rate
reset; the second must run to final maturity, though a demand feature may be used
for either. At the 2025-06-30 report date, counting each fund once by keeping the
latest filing for its series identifier, 309 funds report. Their median weighted
average maturity is 31 days against a maximum of 59, and their median life 58 days
against a maximum of 116. No fund exceeds either cap, and none in this snapshot
reports a life shorter than its maturity. Keeping every filing
instead would count 322, because 13 amendments restate a filing already present and
sometimes change the figures.

The distance between the two measures describes a portfolio rather than measuring
slack. Its median is 30 days and its maximum 102. Government funds run the widest
gap, a median 49 days across 227 funds; prime funds run 19; and the 25 funds in the
broad tax exempt category run 0. Those category-level summaries establish a
difference in reported maturity profiles, but these two aggregate sources do not
identify the securities or features that cause it. Funds with the same weighted
average maturity can report different weighted average lives, so the maturity
measure alone does not determine the life measure.

Liquidity is reported daily and has to be screened before it is read. Across the
whole liquidity file 449 rows, 0.5950 percent, report zero weekly liquid assets in
both dollars and percent. The case treats them as an anomaly-screening population:
81 of the 317 series carry at least one, but for those series a zero is a median
0.8734 percent of their own observations and their median reading when positive is
84.7400 percent, and only 1 series reports zero throughout. A fund that genuinely
held nothing weekly liquid would not usually report eighty-five percent on the rest
of its days, but that pattern does not prove why a filer reported zero. All 309
funds carry a liquidity row dated the report date, 2 of them are
these zeros, and the 307 that remain hold a median 84.0000 percent of assets in
weekly liquid form and 71.8200 percent in daily liquid form.

Counting apparent breaches of the 25 percent daily and 50 percent weekly minimums
then takes two corrections the data does not supply. Taken raw, 18 funds sit below
the daily minimum and 2 below the weekly one. Dropping the zero rows leaves 16 and
0, so no fund is below the weekly minimum at all. Of the 16, 14 are tax exempt
funds, which the rule does not subject to the daily requirement, leaving 2 that it
does. Both of those report 100.0000 percent weekly liquid assets. The daily and
weekly measures cover different qualifying asset sets, so the readings are not
internally contradictory; what these two funds actually hold is not shown here.
Even for them the thresholds
condition what a fund may acquire rather than setting a level it must hold, so an
observation below one is not by itself a violation.

Regression probes measured in the `money_fund_maturity_liquidity` sweep include
keeping every accession, retaining zero-liquidity rows, narrowing the tax-exempt
category set, using the pre-2024 daily threshold and substituting means for medians.
The query pins each calculation choice, so these are baseline instruction-following
probes rather than a live hidden-method trap. This is a hard baseline case.

Rule 2a-7 context used by the case: weighted average maturity and weighted average
life are distinct measures; tax-exempt money market funds are not subject to the
daily liquid asset acquisition test; and the daily and weekly minimums condition
acquisitions rather than requiring a fund to remain above the percentage at every
instant.

Boundaries: this is one report date and a fund's position moves daily. The zero rows
are treated as missing on the evidence of the same funds' other observations, which
is an inference rather than a statement from the filer. Whether a fund complied
depends on what it acquired and when, which these fields cannot show. The
single-state funds are read as tax exempt on the strength of their category name.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts match exactly.

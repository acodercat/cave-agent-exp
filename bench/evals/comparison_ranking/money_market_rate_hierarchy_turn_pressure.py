"""Compare overnight benchmark segments, target-range placement and date effects.

TGCR, BGCR and SOFR are nested but distinct Treasury-repo benchmarks; OBFR and
EFFR measure unsecured overnight bank-funding segments.  The New York Fed
publishes each as a volume-weighted median.  Cross-benchmark ordering and a
SOFR-minus-EFFR spread are descriptive comparisons of different transaction
populations, not an identification of credit risk, dealer constraints or any
other causal driver.

The FOMC target range is for the federal funds rate.  EFFR is a market statistic
steered within that range through administered tools; SOFR is not the policy
target and has no compliance boundary at the range edges.  Its location inside
the range on one day does not by itself diagnose funding pressure.

The case measures SOFR deviations on four named quarter-end or last-business-day
observations relative to the prior five complete-panel dates.  Heterogeneous
deviations establish date sensitivity in the sample only; the rates table does
not observe balance-sheet management or prove a reporting-date mechanism.

SOFR's 99th percentile and published rate are volume-weighted distribution
statistics, not borrower identities.  Treasury's one- and three-month values are
interpolated constant-maturity par yields derived from indicative bid-side market
quotes, not observed bill transaction yields.  Subtracting them from SOFR is a
cross-instrument, cross-horizon comparison and cannot by itself define a single
money-market yield-curve inversion.

The convention sweep measures the turn reference rate, the spread statistic, the
turn baseline, the tail measure and the tail threshold.  Measuring the quarter-end
deviations on BGCR instead of SOFR reads the first, third and fourth as 1, 5 and 6
basis points rather than 3, 12 and 9, and moves the largest-deviation date from
2024-09-30 to 2024-12-31; taking the mean secured-minus-unsecured spread instead
of the median reports +0.144 basis points rather than -1 basis point; baselining
on the previous business day instead of the prior five complete-panel dates reads
the first, second and fourth as 1, -1 and 12 rather than 3, 0 and 9; measuring
the tail as the target range's full width instead of upper bound minus SOFR
reports 12 wide days and a 62-basis-point maximum on 2024-09-30 rather than 6
days and 52 basis points on 2024-09-19; and a 20-basis-point
threshold reports 8 wide days rather than 6.  The query pins all five choices.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts and dates match exactly.

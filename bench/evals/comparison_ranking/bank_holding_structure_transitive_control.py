"""Trace direct controlled relationships through the current FFIEC NIC snapshot.

The FFIEC relationship table mixes relationship grains and control statuses. This
case builds its graph only from rows whose relationship level is 1 (direct) and
whose control indicator is 1 (controlled). The full source contains 35,922 rows
and three repeated parent-offspring pairs. After the graph filter, 34,159 entities
appear as endpoints and 3,599 appear as parents but never offspring. Four strongly
connected groups contain nine entities, so traversal still needs a visited set.

The median top-level entity has 1 direct controlled offspring and 2 reachable
entities, and 38.1773 percent reach beyond their direct offspring. Morgan Stanley
has the largest transitive reach: 73 direct offspring, 4,129 reachable entities, a
ratio of 56.5616, and a maximum shortest-path depth of 11. Goldman Sachs ranks
second with 3,690 reachable entities and Truist third with 2,313.

Legal-entity reach is not a balance-sheet size measure. Among the descendants of
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Truist, respectively 2, 2 and 1 carry a nonmissing
FDIC certificate in the identifier table. Certificate presence is an operational
linkage flag here; the available identifier table does not establish current deposit
insurance status for every linked entity.

The source relationship level is not the graph depth derived from a selected top.
It reads 1 on 35,868 rows and takes another value on 54; non-1 rows already describe
indirect relationships and therefore are not one-step graph edges. Using shortest
distance on the direct controlled graph, the leader is widest at level 4 with 2,090
entities, has 3 at its deepest level, and reaches 20 identifiers absent from the
institution table.

Regression probes in the `bank_holding_transitive_control` sweep include treating
every control status as controlled, treating indirect relationships as direct
edges, ranking by direct offspring, including the root, and shifting the depth
origin. The query pins the graph grain and control code, so these are baseline
instruction-following probes rather than a hidden-method trap. This is a hard
baseline case.

Boundaries: the file is a current snapshot, so the results do not date a structure
or survive a reorganization. A top-level entity here means a parent that never
appears as an offspring in the filtered snapshot, not an ultimate owner in an
absolute legal sense. Entities reachable from more than one top-level parent are
counted under each, so descendant counts across parents do not add.

Numeric validation uses the shared 0.6 x 10^-N rounding-boundary tolerance for
N requested decimals; counts and entity names match exactly.
